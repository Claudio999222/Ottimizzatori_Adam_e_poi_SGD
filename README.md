# Optimizers: Adam and SGD

## Overview

Optimizers play a crucial role in training deep learning models. This example demonstrates the use of two popular optimizers, Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in the training process. We'll train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Adam initially and then continue training using SGD.

## Steps:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Import the required libraries, including TensorFlow and any other relevant libraries for your model.

2. **Model Definition**: Define your CNN model. In this example, we assume you have a model named `model`.

3. **Adam Optimizer**: Compile your model using the Adam optimizer.

4. **Training with Adam**: Fit the model using the Adam optimizer.

5. **Continue Training with SGD**: After a few epochs, continue training the model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer.
